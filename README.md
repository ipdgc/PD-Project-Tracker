## Goal

To create a user-friendly portal for viewing and updating ongoing IPDGC projects.

## How
Shiny will provide the front-end web-application for the user. Shiny server will communicate with Team Google Drive for IPDGC to retrieve and edit information from the IPDGC project sheet.

## Feature roadmap
### Tier 1: To be implemented ASAP
* Retrieving information
* Editing information
* Mark project as DONE
* Automatically archive complete projects to "completed" section
* Contact information for authors
* Indexing: provide each project with unique ID
* Search function
* Basic authentication for corsortium members
* Multi-level Status-break down “ongoing” status to different levels
    * e.g. analysis ongoing, submitted & awaiting response, revision submitted
* Basic UI - Start with sidebar + big table
### Tier 2: Useful features-if there is enough time
* Allow users to insert/propose new projects from the app
* Add following tags to the projects:
    * Github
    * Biorxiv links
    * Project categories
    * Journal submitted/accepted
    * Keywords - from pre-selected list
### Tier 3: Optional
* Trainee-led project highlighting/category
* Individual level/institutional level password/account
* How to deal with sub-projects within a larger project?
    * Provide larger working groups + large projects (e.g. LARGE-PD) with their own category or section
* Word cloud- formed from “brief summary” section
    * Individual project based
    * Consortium level - "bird's-eye view"
* Improve UI- make it more reactive, user-friendly, simplistic
