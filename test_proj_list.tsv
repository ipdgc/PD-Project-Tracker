In Review	The endocytic membrane trafficking pathway on the risk of PD	We systematically explore the genetic contribution of 252 pathway-specific genes on the risk for PD. We set out to study to what extent common variation within these genes may play a role on PD by performing genome-wide heritability estimations and risk profiling analysis in IPDGC GWAS data. We also apply Mendelian randomization to investigate possible functional genomic associations versus expression and methylation patterns that might be relevant in PD.
