ongoing	The endocytic membrane trafficking pathway on the risk of PD	We systematically explore the genetic contribution of 252 pathway-specific genes on the risk for PD. We set out to study to what extent common variation within these genes may play a role on PD by performing genome-wide heritability estimations and risk profiling analysis in IPDGC GWAS data. We also apply Mendelian randomization to investigate possible functional genomic associations versus expression and methylation patterns that might be relevant in PD.

Stratification; Lessons from Parkinson’s Disease"	"Using GRS and and variant status of Parkisnon's 
patients to simulate differences between randomly 
assigned clinical trial groups. We are now translating
these findings into how these differences would affect a 
measurable clinical PD phenotype, and thus ultimately clinical 
trial outcome, using recent results from a recent PD 
progession study."	"Nalls, Gan-Or, Singleton"	"Hampton Leonard, Hirotaka Iwaki, Cornelis Blauwendraat, Faraz Faghri, Andrew Singleton, Mike Nalls"	2017	GoogleDoc of manuscript	Submitted	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/427385	9				
ongoing	Mitochondrial enrichment in PD	"We focus on genes expressed in mitochondria and examine the enrichment for the mutations in PD patients. As mitochondrial dysfunction is common endpoint for PD, it's feasible to speculate that PD patients have more variants in the genes regulating mitochondrial function."

ongoing	LRRK2 G2019S Age of onset analysis	DNM3 has been identified as an age of onset modifier of G2019S carriers. Several small reports have shown that this finding might not be true in general or at least not in all populations. Main goal is to scrutinize whether this effect is real or not.

ongoing	ADH1C in PD replication	ADH1C stop mutation had been reported to be associated with PD in a JAMA Neurology paper from 2015. We will use the IPDGC data to examine this association and write a short letter.	Gan-Or	"Kim, Bandres-Ciga , Blauwendraat , Singleton, Gan-Or"	18-Dec	Draft of letter	18-Dec		13
